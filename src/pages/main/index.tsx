      <i>Welcome</i> to The Sebs ARG Escape Room. On your journey full of twists
      and turns, you will experience tasks that invoke concoctions of knowledge
      and wit. The main objective of the “semi-virtual escape room” is to unlock
      every “lock” present in the game. This task is achieved by setting out on
      a series of QR Codes, Cards and Clues, and Videos. When the victor
      emerges, a glorious GRAND PRIZE OF YOUR LUNCH/DESERT PICK FOR THE ENTIRE
      SCHOOL FOR A DAY, AND A SEBS CAP, awaits.
      <br />
      <br />
      QR Codes: QR codes are physical posts around the school. Scan the QR code
      to reveal a card, which will present a puzzle to solve. However, some QR
      codes are already blocked! You can’t access these QR codes until
      completing previous steps.
      <br />
      <br />
      Cards: Cards are essentially the your clues. You want to gain cards, since
      cards hold most of the information to find the codes for locks. Cards are
      revealed through both QR codes and unlocking locks. Cards will reveal a
      puzzle for you to solve, which will solve for numbers/letters used for
      encrypted locks. A lock may require more than one card to be able to do
      the puzzle.
      <br />
      <br />
      Locks: Locks are all well...locked. What does this mean? You need
      information to unlock them. This solution is likely a four number/letter
      combination, which can be found by solving puzzles. Unlocking locks are
      essential to progress through the game.
      <br />
      <br />
      Paths: You might notice that some cards have different colors. These
      colors symbolize what path they are. A path is a group of cards/locks. To
      win you must complete the Start path and one of the other two paths. The
      Chase path is unlocked once you finish the start path. The Antivirus path
      is unlocked by finding a secret QR code.
      <br />
      <br />
      Videos: Videos are fun additions to an already complex system. Videos may
      feature hidden clues that are helping in unlocking locks.
      <br />
      <br />
      Puzzles: Puzzles require both knowledge and intellect. Some may be in the
      deepest depths of the internet, or the smallest nook on campus. The
      solutions to puzzles reveal unlock codes for locks.
      <br />
      <br />
      Play space: The game will span over the entire school. As we are not able
      to put physical locks on the doors, this means you can go from the
      Academic building all the way to the Athletic building depending on you
      clue.
